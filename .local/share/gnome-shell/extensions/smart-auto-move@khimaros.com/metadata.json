  "description": "Smart Auto Move learns the position, size, and workspace of your application windows and restores them on subsequent launches. Supports Wayland.\n\nNOTE: Optimized for use with static workspaces. For more control, set the default behavior to IGNORE and then selectively RESTORE only desired apps.\n\nKNOWN ISSUES: Multi-monitor  is not yet well supported. You may need to manually delete Saved Windows in preferences after adding or removing a display.",
